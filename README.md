# Noni's Portfolio Project
This is a demo website for educational practice for my software engineering fellowship, Pursuit. 

This project is designed to test all of the skills I've learned thus far. This project is a demo website that demonstrates my software skills to create a deployable front-end application. The website allos for user interaction through button clicks and form inputs. Information on the website is populated via <a> tags and API calls. 
  
## Website Theme
The Theme of my website is Climate Change. I chose this theme because I climate change is REAL and it affects everyone. I saw an opportunity to make people more aware of climate change and wanted to use this website project to provide reliable information and tips to educate and hopefully mitigate the overuse of resources.  

## Application Design
Within this project there will be 4 files. 
  
  #### main.html
This is my main.html file. This file is the first page of my website. In this file one can read all about climate change. Here you can explore many resources. Resources are provide in a variety of ways: in the comments, API generated, related links(<a> tags) and more.
  
  There are 6 sections in this file:
  - There is the "About" section that gives an overall description of climate change
  - There is the "Articles" section. Here you will find a fun interactive section of 3-API populated articles from reputable resources. 
  - There is a "User's Search" section that contains a dropdown menu where uses can choose their information source. When a source is selected a second API request will be made to retrieve articles from that specific source, check it out - it's pretty cool and you should read more! 
  - There is a "Mitigate Climate Change" section that has environment-friendly tips to help reduce wear and tear on our planet. 
  - There is a "Contact" section to report any bugs or issues with the articles or information presented on the page
  - Lastly, there is the "JavaScript" section for my HTML code to make the page more fun and interactive
  
  
  #### aboutMe.html
  This is my second page that is accessible via the "about me" button. This page is not related to climate change instead you'll find information about the developer, which is me  :)! Here you can look at my previous projects, download my CV, and send me inquiries. I wanted to do more but I lost time and didn't have enough time to fully indulge in this project like I wanted to, this is pretty much my filler page to fulfill the requirements, shhhhh - nobody has to know, hahaha! 
  
  
  #### script.js
  This is all my other JavaScript that is not included in the HTML file. Be aware that there are some non-used code in there. I actually have another file called "hardcode.js" which is my original code that was all bulky and yucky. I made some adjustments to the code to give birth to this one, so don't judge me for having some non-used variables. I thought about deleting them but I was very hestitate; I didn't want to risk making my code buggy. 
  
  #### styles.css & styles2.css
These are my CSS files for my HTML code. styles.css is for the main.html file and styles2.css is for my aboutMe.html file. Pretty solid, right? In these files there's a lot going on - warning I also created some classes in my HTML files that I did not use in the CSS, again don't judge me. Afterall, I am a beginner okay, which means I am still learning, hahaha! Give me some slack, hahaha! All jokes aside, you'll find the pages to be reponsive - lol. 


I think that's all for now. Thank you for stopping by!
